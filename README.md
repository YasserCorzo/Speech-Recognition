# Speech-Recognition
Coursework from my Speech Recogition course. Includes 4 coding assignments:
1. Speech recognition systems use acoustic features that can range from raw audio to signal processing motivated features like Log Mel Filterbanks (LMF), spectrograms, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). I implemented python code to compute LMF features from raw audio files.
2. Implemented a HMM-GMM model for speech based keyword classification.
3. Implemented a CTC-based speech recognition system. Specifically, I implemented the forward and backward computations for CTC, the n-gram language model class, and the greedy and beam search inference algorithms.
4. I implemented an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) with Transformers for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). I also trained and decoded models using the provided train/dev/test data. Used PSC bridges machines to train these models. 

Some python libraries involved in these assignments: numpy, pytorch, tensorflow, etc.
